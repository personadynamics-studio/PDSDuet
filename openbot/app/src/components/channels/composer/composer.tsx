   * The image half of a paste that our own listener let through.
   *
   * `PromptArea` has its own rule for a clipboard carrying BOTH text and an image: if the
   * `text/html` is Microsoft Office markup it inserts the TEXT and ignores the image, because a
   * copied Excel cell or Word block is text that happens to ship a picture of itself. Anything else
   * it treats as an image, calls this, and RETURNS — having already called `preventDefault` and
   * inserted nothing.
   *
   * WHICH SOURCES LAND WHERE, SAID PLAINLY, BECAUSE THE SECOND GROUP IS NOT COVERED. Word and Excel
   * write Office markup, so their text is typed. Google Sheets and Numbers do not, so they take the
   * second branch: this prop attaches their image and THEIR TEXT IS NOT TYPED. Having the prop is
   * still strictly better than not having it — without it that same paste calls nothing at all, so
   * there is no text AND no attachment, which is the failure our own listener was written to avoid
   * — but it does not make the spreadsheet case right, and this does not claim it does. See
   * `shouldClaimPaste` in `shared/attachments.ts` for the rule and for why it is being kept.
   *
   * Routing it into `stageFiles` means the file arrives by the same door as the picker and the
   * drop, so it is screened, capped and refused in the same words.
   *
   * EVERY BRANCH BELOW HAS TO PASS IT, WHICH IS THE WHOLE OF THIS PROP'S CORRECTNESS. It went on
   * the compact one alone for a while, and the full-size branch — the shape the home screen draws
   * — swallowed exactly this paste in silence. `composer-paste.test.tsx` renders that branch for
   * no other reason.

   * With no handler at all — which is what `dropZone` used to spread whenever `canAttach` was
   * false — the composer is not a target, `drop` never fires on it, and the browser performs ITS
   * default for a file dropped on a document: it NAVIGATES THE TOP-LEVEL DOCUMENT TO THAT FILE.
   *
   * The comment this replaces called those "drag handlers it would only ignore". Ignoring is the
   * one thing that does not happen. The single-page app unloads and everything held in memory goes
   * with it: the sentence being typed on `/channel/new`, and on a `disabled` channel the entire
   * parked queue — whose own teardown effect in `conversation-view.tsx` never gets to run, because
   * the document is being REPLACED rather than unmounted, so the rows behind those parked messages
   * stay orphaned until the 24-hour sweep. The person sees their raw PNG on a blank page and
   * presses Back.
   *
   * ALWAYS INSTALLED; ONLY THE ACCEPTANCE IS CONDITIONAL. The states that reach here are the three
   * the `channelId` docblock names — `/channel/new`, the home screen, the onboarding poster — plus
   * every channel whose composer is `disabled`.
   *
   * THE APP-WIDE GUARD NOW EXISTS, AND THIS IS STILL NOT REDUNDANT. `useUnclaimedDropGuard` in
   * `routes/__root.tsx` refuses any drop nobody claimed, which covers the transcript, the sidebar,
   * the page margin and the onboarding poster's `pointer-events-none` composer — every surface a
   * leaf could never reach. It deliberately stands down the moment an event is already
   * `defaultPrevented`, because that is the browser's own signal that something in the tree owns
   * the drop. So the two do not fight, and they do different jobs: the root one can only refuse
   * silently, since it has no idea what the person was aiming at. This one KNOWS, and names the
   * file and the reason in `RejectedFiles`. Deleting it would turn a sentence into silence on the

   * can never render it, which is a broken-image icon where a filename should be.
   *
   * ONLY A `url` SOURCE'S `mimeType` IS EVIDENCE, which is why the narrowing below is not
   * defensive noise. A `data` source's `mimeType` is `file.type` — the very claim being refused,
   * wearing the name of an answer — and only a `url` source has been past the server, which sniffs
   * the bytes. `attachmentModality` falls back to the declared type when there is nothing
   * corroborated, so an attachment still uploading is drawn exactly as it used to be and settles
   * onto the truth when the server answers. That settle is the one visible cost: a mislabelled
   * screenshot spends its upload as a file card. The alternative is holding every tile back until
   * the answer, which would make every ordinary attachment feel slower to spare a rare one a
